        I am writing to express my heartfelt appreciation for the outstanding service provided by your team during our recent Bali trip organized by Traveling Company. From the moment we booked our trip, Amit Khanvilkar has been incredibly helpful and attentive to our needs, assisting us with flights, accommodations, and various activities throughout our stay.

          We had gone to Paradise resort island resort, Maldives for our honeymoon and we had a wonderful time. Flamingo travels made our booking and the speed boat arrangements.
The resort is just outstanding. Apart from the water sport activities, there are lot of other things and places to explore in the resort. The room service is excellent and the resort staff is very cordial. Flamingo staff Mr Amit Khanvilkar made sure that we have a flawless journey. Overall, it was an amazing experience.
